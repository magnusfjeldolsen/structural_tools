When creating html-files, ensure that every page has a google tag directly after <head>
Here are the instructions from google analytics

Below is the Google tag for this account. Copy and paste it in the code of every page of your website, immediately after the <head> element. Donâ€™t add more than one Google tag to each page.
<!-- Google tag (gtag.js) -->
<script async src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=G-BFVZQQ2LYN"></script>
<script>
  window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];
  function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments);}
  gtag('js', new Date());

  gtag('config', 'G-BFVZQQ2LYN');
</script>
