When prompted to create or modify a module, look inside global-devspecs. 
Consider both plan_IO-structure_for_modules.md, detailed-report-implementation-plan.md and README.md as well as other relevant document names according to the prompt you are given. 

Always propose a plan on what you will do. If in auto-accept, present the plan and start coding.
