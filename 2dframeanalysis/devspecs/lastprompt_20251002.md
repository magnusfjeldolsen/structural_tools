some of the element input is still behind the frame visualization. i might have to reorganize the page a little, how about this:
- Frame Visualization is at the top
- Below it is first Nords and Elements in "structure" tab, for now, side by side such that the user can easily copy node names to elements for fast "connectivity"
- Then there is also a "load" tab which shows only the load input, in which im going to make more comprehensive very soon.

this maks the frame visualization the most important part of the app. 
if there is not enought space for nodes and elements side by side, make them on top of each other
Great idea! This reorganization makes much more sense - Frame Visualization as the focal point, then a tabbed interface for Structure (Nodes + Elements) and Loads. Let me implement this:
Update Todos

Create tab navigation system (Structure/Loads)

Move Frame Visualization to top

Reorganize Nodes and Elements side by side in Structure tab

Move Loads to separate tab

Add responsive layout for narrow screens

Test new layout
