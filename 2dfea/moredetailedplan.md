here’s a concrete, step-by-step coding plan you can take straight into your editor. It’s ordered so you always have a working prototype (MVP) and then progressively add features (snapping, precision input, analysis, polishing). For each milestone I give: goal, discrete tasks, acceptance criteria, tests, and suggested commit message(s). No time estimates — just clear, testable steps.

1 — Project bootstrap (repo + dev environment)

Goal: Create a working React + TypeScript app scaffold with Konva and Zustand installed.

Tasks

npm init vite@latest (or CRA) + TypeScript template.

Install dependencies: react, react-dom, typescript, react-konva, konva, zustand.

Add ESLint + Prettier, basic tsconfig.

Create top-level folders: src/components, src/store, src/geometry, src/hooks, src/types, src/analysis.

Add a basic App.tsx and render a blank CanvasView.

Acceptance criteria

npm run dev builds and serves the app.

Blank canvas loads with no runtime errors.

Tests / verification

Lint runs cleanly.

Dev server console has no exceptions.

Suggested commits

init: project scaffold + dependencies

chore: add eslint + prettier config

2 — Basic model & store (nodes and elements)

Goal: Implement the core data model and store with add/move/select operations and undo/redo middleware scaffold.

Tasks

Create types/modelTypes.ts (Node, Element, Tool, SnapMode).

Implement store/useModelStore.ts with:

nodes: Node[], elements: Element[]

addNode(x,y), addElement(n1,n2), moveNode(id,x,y), removeNode, getNodeById

Implement store/useUIStore.ts for tool & snap settings.

Add simple undo/redo middleware skeleton (push snapshots or diffs).

Acceptance criteria

Programmatic calls to addNode and addElement update state.

Moving a node updates element geometries (elements reference node IDs).

Undo/redo hook exists and can revert a recent add/move.

Tests / verification

Unit tests for store actions (e.g., addNode creates node, moveNode changes coordinates).

Snapshot tests for undo/redo behaviour.

Suggested commits

feat(store): add model store + basic actions

feat(store): add UI store skeleton + undo middleware

3 — Canvas rendering & basic interaction (MVP: draw nodes & elements)

Goal: Render nodes and lines and allow user to add nodes by clicking and draw elements between nodes (click node A then B).

Tasks

Implement CanvasView.tsx with Stage, Layer, render nodes as Circle, elements as Line.

Implement hooks/useMouseHandlers.ts to:

On click: create node at stage coordinates when in draw tool.

Support creating an element by: click node (start) -> click node (end) -> addElement.

Implement coordinate transform utils to map screen → world coordinates (for future zoom/pan).

Add basic visual feedback (hover highlight, temporary rubber-band line while drawing).

Acceptance criteria

Clicking on canvas adds a node.

Clicking on one node then another creates an element between them.

UI shows a visible temporary line when user is selecting second node.

Tests / verification

Manual test: add 3 nodes and connect them into elements.

Unit test: addElement connects the correct node IDs.

Suggested commits

feat(canvas): render nodes + elements

feat(interaction): draw tool + rubberband line

4 — Selection / move tool & simple dragging

Goal: Implement selection and direct manipulation; user can select nodes and drag them updating connected elements.

Tasks

Implement select and move tools in useUIStore.

Add hit-testing: on mouse down near a node (distance < tolerance) select it.

Dragging a selected node calls moveNode in store; elements update visually.

Support multi-select (shift+click) to select multiple nodes.

Acceptance criteria

Selected nodes are visually distinct.

Dragging node updates its coordinates and connected lines move.

Multi-select works (shift to add/remove from selection).

Tests / verification

Manual: create 2 nodes connected, drag one — line endpoint follows.

Unit: hit test function returns nearest node under cursor.

Suggested commits

feat(interaction): add select + move tools

test: add hit-test unit tests

5 — Viewport controls (pan & zoom) and transform mapping

Goal: Implement pan & zoom with correct coordinate mapping so mouse interactions are consistent under transforms.

Tasks

Add zoom and pan fields in useUIStore.

Implement transformUtils to convert screen coords → world coords and back.

Implement mouse wheel zoom centered on cursor and middle-drag pan.

Ensure Stage uses scaleX/scaleY and x/y props from store.

Acceptance criteria

Zoom centers on mouse pointer.

Pan moves the view; drawing and snapping still target world coordinates correctly.

All interactions (click to add node, drag to move) work under zoom/pan.

Tests / verification

Manual: zoom and add nodes at precise locations; verify coordinates reported in StatusBar match model coordinates.

Suggested commits

feat(view): pan + zoom with transforms

6 — Snapping basics (endpoints, grid, midpoints)

Goal: Add snapping engine with endpoint, grid, and midpoint snapping and visual snap preview.

Tasks

Implement geometry/geometryUtils.ts with vector utils: distance, projectPointOnLine, midpoint, line-line intersection.

Implement geometry/snapUtils.ts with findSnapPoint(x,y, nodes, elements, modes) that returns best snap candidate and type.

Add UI toggles for snap modes in Toolbar and show visual indicator (small marker) when snapping occurs.

Add a SNAP_TOLERANCE constant (pixels in world coords) to central config.

Acceptance criteria

Cursor shows snap marker when close to endpoint or midpoint.

Clicking near an endpoint places node exactly at the endpoint.

Grid snap snaps to nearest grid intersection when enabled.

Tests / verification

Unit tests for projectPointOnLine, midpoint, nearestPointOnLine.

Integration: draw two lines that cross — hovering near intersection should detect intersection (if intersection snap enabled).

Suggested commits

feat(snap): add geometry utils + endpoint/midpoint/grid snapping

test(snap): unit tests for geometry utils

7 — Intersection snapping, perpendicular and angular constraints

Goal: Add more advanced snaps: intersection of lines, perpendicular snap, angle snap (e.g., 15° increments).

Tasks

Extend snapUtils to compute line intersections and perpendicular foot from cursor to a chosen line.

Add angle snapping: when creating or moving a line, constrain to nearest angle multiple (configurable).

Add keyboard modifiers (e.g., hold Shift to lock angle, Ctrl to force perpendicular).

Acceptance criteria

Intersection snap finds the exact crossing point between two non-parallel elements.

Angle snap locks new element direction to nearest allowed angle when modifier is active.

Visual hint shows the constrained angle (small angular overlay).

Tests / verification

Manual: create a cross shape and test snapping to the crossing point.

Unit: test angleBetweenPoints and rounding to nearest angle step.

Suggested commits

feat(snap-advanced): add intersection, perpendicular, and angle snapping

8 — Numeric coordinate input (absolute & relative)

Goal: Allow the user to enter precise coordinates (absolute) and relative movement (@dx,dy), integrate into selection and move flows.

Tasks

Create CoordinateInput.tsx that shows current selected node(s) coordinates.

Support input formats:

Absolute: x,y -> set node to (x,y)

Relative: @dx,dy -> move node by delta

Polar shorthand (optional): r<angle -> place relative by length+angle

Hook input to store actions (moveNode, addNode) and create parsing utils that validate input.

Acceptance criteria

Typing @10,0 moves selected node +10 on X.

Typing 100,50 moves selected node to (100,50) in world coordinates.

Invalid input gives inline validation error.

Tests / verification

Unit tests for parsing functions.

Manual tests for absolute and relative moves under zoom/pan.

Suggested commits

feat(ui): numeric coordinate input (abs & relative)

9 — Undo/Redo, persistence, and model export

Goal: Robust undo/redo stack, save/load model JSON, and optionally localStorage autosave.

Tasks

Complete undoRedoMiddleware.ts with action-based or snapshot-based history, limit history size.

Add actions: undo(), redo(), bind to Ctrl+Z / Ctrl+Y.

Add File menu: Export JSON, Import JSON.

Autosave to localStorage on each commit (configurable).

Acceptance criteria

Undo/redo reliably reverts add/move/delete and edge cases.

Exported JSON re-imports to identical state.

Autosave reloads on page refresh.

Tests / verification

Manual undo/redo sequences with multi-select and element creation.

Unit: simulate sequence of store ops and verify history restores prior states.

Suggested commits

feat(history): undo/redo middleware

feat(persist): export/import + autosave

10 — UI polish, keyboard shortcuts, and accessibility

Goal: Add keyboard shortcuts, tooltips, and basic accessibility.

Tasks

Implement useKeyboardShortcuts.ts to handle tool switching (D draw, S select, M move), snap toggles, undo/redo keys.

Add tool tips, status bar showing active snap and coordinates.

Make nodes focusable and provide ARIA labels for screen readers.

Add Konva hit area size adjustments for better touch usability.

Acceptance criteria

Keyboard shortcuts change tools and toggles.

Tooltips appear when hovering toolbar icons.

Basic keyboard accessibility for selecting nodes.

Tests / verification

Manual: test shortcuts, focus order.

Accessibility audit with browser devtools.

Suggested commits

feat(ui): add keyboard shortcuts + tooltips

chore(a11y): add aria labels and focus support

11 — Analysis engine integration (starter FEM)

Goal: Add a basic frame solver to compute displacements under loads (linear elastic) and visualize results.

Tasks

Create analysis/frameSolver.ts:

Node DOF indexing, assemble global stiffness matrix for 2D frame (axial + bending if you choose; start with axial/truss if simpler).

Apply boundary conditions and loads.

Solve linear system (use a simple Cholesky or call a tiny linear solver).

Add UI to assign supports and loads to nodes/elements.

Add a results layer: color-coded axial force or deflection; add scale factor for displacement visualization.

Acceptance criteria

Small example with defined supports and a load computes reactions and nodal displacements.

Results render overlay (deformed shape scaled).

Tests / verification

Compare solver result for a simple 2-member cantilever to an analytical solution.

Unit tests for matrix assembly on a trivial mesh.

Suggested commits

feat(analysis): add basic frame solver + results visualization

12 — Performance, testing, and large-model considerations

Goal: Make the app robust for larger models and add automated tests.

Tasks

Optimize rendering: batch redraws, throttle mousemove (use requestAnimationFrame), only re-render layers that changed.

Replace naive loops with spatial indexing (e.g., simple quadtree) for hit-testing if needed.

Add end-to-end tests with Playwright/Cypress for common flows (draw, snap, move, export/import).

Add performance profiling tests (measure FPS and memory for models of increasing size).

Acceptance criteria

App remains responsive for hundreds of nodes/elements.

E2E tests pass in CI.

Tests / verification

Run headless E2E tests.

Manual profiling with devtools.

Suggested commits

perf: optimize rendering + hit-testing

test(e2e): add drawing and move flows

13 — Advanced features & extensibility (optional)

Ideas to add later

Layer system (hide/show elements, group).

Constraint solver for rigid/flexible joints.

Crosshair & measurement tool.

Snap refinement tools (snap priorities, custom snap radius per mode).

Export to DXF/IFC or integration with CAD.

Collaboration / realtime edit via WebSockets.

Developer notes & helpful constants

Centralize constants in src/config/constants.ts: SNAP_TOLERANCE, NODE_RADIUS, HIT_TOLERANCE, grid spacing, angle snap increment.

Always convert pointer positions using transformUtils.screenToWorld(stage, pointer) to guard against zoom/pan bugs.

Keep geometry pure and stateless — geometry/* functions should accept inputs and return results (easy to unit test).

Keep UI stores (tool, pan, zoom) separate from model store (nodes/elements) to simplify undo/redo scoping.

Suggested branching & commit strategy

main — always green & deployable.

Feature branches per milestone: feat/canvas-mvp, feat/snapping, feat/analysis.

Use small commits per logical change (rendering, interaction, tests).

Example commit flow: feat(canvas): add rendering of nodes → feat(canvas): add draw tool → test(canvas): add unit tests
